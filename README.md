# kubesly
A simple tool for managing secrets in Kubernetes
The tool is currently very work in progress and features are in planning phase.  
Here's how I'm planning it to work:
- [ ] CLI application (eg. `kubesly create secret secretname.default --text=key=value`)
- [ ] A web service where you can handle secrets
- [ ] REST api where you can handle secrets
- [ ] (Maybe) RPC API for secret handling

## What does kubesly do?
kubesly works like an operator on top of Kubernetes.
